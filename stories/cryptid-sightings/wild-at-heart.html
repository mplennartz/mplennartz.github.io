                <p>The Bureau received an urgent call from New Jersey Department of Homeland Security regarding a mangled body discovered in the Pine Barrens. Local authorities initially attributed the death to animal attack, but wildlife rangers noted <span class="spooky">unusual bite patterns</span> inconsistent with known local fauna.</p>
                
                <p>Ranger Kessler, who discovered the body, reported bipedal tracks leading away from the crime scene that defied classification. The victim, an unidentified transient, showed signs of both blunt force trauma and post-mortem feeding behavior. The combination of humanoid bite marks and non-human gait patterns immediately triggered Bureau involvement.</p>
                
                <p>Local folklore surrounding the Jersey Devil legend provided additional context for the investigation. Historical records indicate similar attacks occurring in clusters, sometimes decades apart, with no discernible pattern to timing or location.</p>

                    <strong>Track Measurements:</strong> Bipedal but non-human gait pattern. Depth suggests 150-200 pound creature. Climbing evidence found in tree bark. Stride length indicates enhanced mobility.<br>
                    <strong>Hair Sample:</strong> Coarse human-like hair, darker than typical human hair. DNA analysis inconclusive. Sample shows signs of environmental adaptation.<br>
