                <p>On October 22, 1998, Silicon Valley Technology Park security contacted local authorities regarding what they described as "vandalism by an exceptionally large individual." Standard police investigation yielded no leads, but when security footage was reviewed, the incident was immediately escalated to the Bureau.</p>
                
                <p>The footage, captured by six different cameras over a 47-minute period, shows a humanoid figure measuring approximately <span class="highlight">8.2 feet in height</span> moving through the underground parking garage with surprising stealth and apparent familiarity with security blind spots.</p>
                
                <p>What began as a routine trespassing investigation became something far more <span class="spooky">extraordinary</span> when digital enhancement revealed details that challenge our understanding of the legendary Sasquatch.</p>

                <p>Investigator 23 arrived on-site with specialized cryptid tracking equipment and our newest digital enhancement technology.

                <p>The most disturbing discovery came during digital enhancement of Frame #47. The creature appears to be looking directly at Camera #3, and lip-reading analysis suggests it may have been <span class="spooky">speaking</span>.</p>

                    <strong>FRAME-BY-FRAME ANALYSIS:</strong><br>
                    00:23:14 - Creature pauses, appears to count cameras<br>
                    00:31:07 - Deliberate movement to avoid motion sensor range<br>
                    00:38:45 - Stops at recycling bins, examines contents<br>

                <p>Hair analysis revealed traces of modern shampoo and what appears to be <span class="terminal-font">hand soap residue</span>. This suggests the creature has regular access to human hygiene products, challenging traditional wilderness-dwelling Sasquatch theories.</p>
                
                <p>Most shocking: thermal imaging shows the creature's body temperature consistently reads <span class="highlight">97.8¬∞F</span> - nearly identical to human core temperature.</p>

                <p>Security analysis reveals the creature has visited this location at least <span class="atmospheric">seven times</span> over the past month, always during the same three-hour window when security patrols are lightest.</p>
                
                <p>Most unsettling: examination of nearby buildings reveals similar unexplained activity. We may be dealing with an entire urban Sasquatch population that has learned to <span class="spooky">hide in plain sight</span>.</p>
