                This is my strangest case yet, and somehow also my most heartwarming. Watched "Eddie" enjoy his cortado this morning. The barista even got the foam art right - a little leaf pattern. The creature studied it for a full minute before drinking.<br><br>
                
                <span class="spooky">A few regular customers have started timing their visits to overlap with Eddie's.
