                <h3 class="section-header">📋 INITIAL DISCOVERY</h3>
                <p>On September 10, 1998, the Scottish Tourism Board launched their new <span class="terminal-font">"LochCam 24/7"</span> - a live webcam positioned on the eastern shore of Loch Ness, streaming directly to their website. Marketed as a way for tourists worldwide to "hunt for Nessie from home," the camera was expected to capture nothing more than lapping water and occasional wildlife.</p>
                
                <p>At 14:23 GMT on September 12, 1998, the webcam captured <span class="highlight">47 seconds</span> of footage that would challenge everything the scientific community believes about the legendary Loch Ness Monster.</p>
                
                <p>Within hours, the footage had been downloaded by over 12,000 viewers before Scottish authorities mysteriously <span class="spooky">"lost the server data"</span> in a convenient technical failure.</p>

                <p>Fortunately, Bureau monitoring systems had automatically archived the stream. Digital analysis of the 47-second clip reveals unprecedented detail of what appears to be a large aquatic creature surfacing approximately 200 meters from shore.</p>
