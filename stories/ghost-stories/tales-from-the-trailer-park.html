                <p>The Bureau received an urgent subcontract from the federal government regarding a perplexing case in Muleshoe, Texas. Local authorities had discovered a <span class="spooky">blood-drained corpse</span> in a dried-out ravine approximately one mile outside of town. The victim, identified as Dale Conklin, a transient with a minor criminal record, exhibited signs of complete blood loss without any animal involvement‚Äîa detail that immediately raised red flags.</p>
                
                <p>Sheriff Dupree's office contacted the Bureau after medical examination revealed bite marks that appeared to have been made <span class="terminal-font">post-mortem</span>. The lack of animal tracks, combined with the precision of the blood extraction, suggested something far more sinister than a simple animal attack.</p>
                
                <p>Investigator 66 was assigned as lead investigator, coordinating a team that included Investigator 07 for field operations, Investigator 13 for medical analysis, Investigator 51 for forensic processing, and Investigator 89 for occult research.</p>
